## High-level Guidelines
We have compile a set of high level guidelines for creating course content. Each course should generally follow this pattern to ensure a uniform experience for learners.

### A course should...
* Take no longer than the event is scheduled for, including time set aside for exercises and demonstrations.
* Have multiple hands-on exercises where students will apply what is being taught during the lecture portions of the class
* Have slides which contain enough explanation to exist as a standalone reference. *Important*
	* A slide template/theme will be supplied
* Have accompanying learner files (including exercises and final solutions).
* Be approachable to the community. This means that it should focus on beginner topics, or have an associated beginner course that learners can take prior.

## Course formats and schedule
Ladies Learning Code (Halifax) has a number of course formats which it uses to target different audiences. When creating a new course you'll want to select the audience you would like to attend, and tailor the content to them.

*Note:* In the short term the Halifax chapter will not be running any custom content workshops beyond the *Code & coffee* format.

### Full day workshop
The standard workshop is a full day of learning. Starting at 10am, breaking up to an hour for lunch, and finishing by 4pm.

These workshops most commonly introduce the learner to a broad set of topics without getting into specific details, if considered intermediate the workshop typically starts with a short refresher on concepts that will be built upon.

*This format is great for:*
* Ladies Learning Code
* Girls Learning Code
* Kids Learning Code

### Half day workshop
Historically used for holiday-themed workshops, as well as kids-focused content. Starting at 1pm and running until 4pm.

*This format is great for:*
* Girls Learning Code
* Kids Learning Code

### Code & coffee
Short 1-3hr sessions which focus either informal help sessions, or specific topics that build on learnings from other courses. Learners are encouraged to come and ask questions about the projects they're working on.

*This format is great for:*
* Ladies Learning Code
* Chapter-specific content

## Distribution of content
How and where the content is accessed and used.

### Github
All courses for Ladies Learning Code are available on Github. Any content created specifically by the Halifax chapter is to be made available on Github in a similar fashion so it is accessible by the community.

A repository will be created for your course, and you will be given access to submit/modify the content. If you wish, someone at the chapter can do this for you.

Each repo should contain:
* A README.md explaining the
